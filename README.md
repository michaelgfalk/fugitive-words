Tracking linguistic remnants in the ocean of Trove

Settler writers in early colonial Australia lived in a predominantly Indigenous society. The dominant languages across Australia were Australian languages. Lacking vocabulary to describe what they saw, the settlers learned about to speak about Australia from Indigenous informants, even while they conquered Indigenous lands and disrupted Indigenous lifeways.

This repository contains some experiments for tracking these process of cultural exchange in [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/), Australia's national research database. Where are the Indigenous words in Trove? Who was writing them? When and why? Using AI, we can hopefully develop a more complete picture of the scene of intercultural exchange in early colonial Australia, before the Frontier Wars and the institutionalisation of Australian Literature closed the doors.
